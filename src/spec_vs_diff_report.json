  "summary": "REQ-3 focuses on fixing the failed deployment so that a standard IC build/deploy succeeds (backend + frontend) and, if it fails, logs pinpoint the failing step. The diff shows only frontend UI/component changes (App, AdminEditor, error state) and a project metadata update; it does not show any changes that directly address dfx build/deploy, backend Motoko compilation, canister init traps, or deployment-step logging.",

      "requirement": "Identify and fix the cause of the failed deployment, ensuring the project builds and deploys successfully using the standard Internet Computer workflow (backend canister + frontend assets).",
      "reason": "The diff contains only frontend component/UI changes and project metadata. There is no evidence of changes to the backend canister (Motoko), dfx configuration/build pipeline, or any deployment-related scripts/config that would fix a dfx deploy failure end-to-end.",

      "requirement": "If the deployment fails again, surface the exact failing step and error output in logs so it is actionable to fix.",
      "reason": "The only logging evidence shown is runtime console error logging in a frontend error component; there is no evidence of build/deploy-step logging (e.g., dfx command output capture, CI logs, or script instrumentation) that would surface the exact failing deployment step.",
